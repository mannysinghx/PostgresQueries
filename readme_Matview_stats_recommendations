# PostgreSQL Materialized View Performance Analyzer

This repository contains a SQL query designed to analyze the performance of materialized views in a PostgreSQL database, specifically within the `cdrv1` schema. The query provides comprehensive insights into the current state of your materialized views, identifies potential performance issues, and suggests optimization techniques.

## Features

- Identifies all materialized views in the `sample` schema
- Gathers detailed statistics on each materialized view
- Calculates size metrics for materialized views and their indexes
- Detects potential performance issues based on various factors
- Provides specific recommendations for performance tuning

## Query Overview

The main query is structured using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize the data gathering and analysis process:

1. `mv_list`: Identifies all materialized views in the `sample` schema.
2. `mv_stats`: Gathers detailed statistics for each materialized view from `pg_stat_user_tables`.
3. `mv_size`: Calculates size metrics for each materialized view and its indexes.

The main SELECT statement then combines this information and adds performance analysis and recommendations.

## Performance Factors Analyzed

The query considers several factors that can affect materialized view performance:

- Number of sequential scans
- Ratio of dead tuples to live tuples
- Vacuum and analyze history
- Number of modifications since the last analyze

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the query may recommend actions such as:

- Creating indexes to reduce sequential scans
- Running VACUUM to clean up dead tuples
- Running ANALYZE to update statistics

## How to Use

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using your preferred client.
2. Copy and paste the entire query into your client.
3. Execute the query.
4. Review the results, paying special attention to the `performance_issue` and `recommended_action` columns.

## Interpreting Results

The query returns one row per materialized view in the `sample` schema. Each row includes:

- Basic information about the materialized view
- Statistical data from `pg_stat_user_tables`
- Size information
- A `performance_issue` column describing any detected issues
- A `recommended_action` column suggesting a specific action to address the issue

## Important Notes

- Always test recommended actions in a non-production environment before applying them to your production database.
- Performance tuning is an iterative process. After making changes, re-run this query and monitor your system's performance to assess the impact.
- The query assumes you have appropriate permissions to access system catalogs and statistics views.

## Customization

You can modify the `schemaname = 'sample'` condition in the query to analyze materialized views in different schemas.
